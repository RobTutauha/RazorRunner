GITHUB WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO UPLOAD MY BUILDS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO LARGE.
Github will not allow me to upload my project in its original structure, limiting me to 100 files at a time.
My PC build is too large for iQualify.

Considering these issues I will bring copies of everything on HDD with me to the presentation in order to give to tutors.
I will upload what I can in the interim.
